 During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[40] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing while using 
the  commodore VIC-20.{41}he taught himself computer programming and by the age 10,sold the code of a basic-based
video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximatley $500{42}{43}.his chidhood
reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of 
actions they are likely to prolong civilization minimize the probability of a dark age reduce the lenght of a dark age
if there is one ".{37}
</p>
<p>Musk was severly bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a
 flight of stairs.[37][40][44][45]
Musk attended waterkloof house preparatory school and bryanston high school{44}before graduating from pretoria boys
high school.{45}although musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria,Musk became determined to move to the
united states saying"i remember thinking and seeing that america is where great things are possible,more than any other
country in the world ."{46}Musk knew it would be easier to get to the united states from canada and moved there against

called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at
 the Palo Alto-based start-up rocket science games.{54}His work at rocket science games involved assembly programming
of device driver Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind apple's quicktime who had  hired Musk, noted: “
He had boundless energy .kids  these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works,
 but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.”[55]
</p>
<p>In 1995,Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at stanford university in califorina Eager to pursue
    opportunities in the internet boom,he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company,Zip2 corporation

<h2>CAREER</h2>
<h2>ZIP2</h2>
<p>main article:zip2</p>

-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when 
they received money through the service.[64] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO 
(although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move 
PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[65] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for 
US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million.[66] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's 
largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[67]

value to him.[68]

<h2>SPACE X</h2>
<p>Main article:SpaceX
In 2001,Musk concived Mars oasis a project to land a  miniature experimentel green house on mars containing 
food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempet to rewanken public interset in space exploration.
in october 2001 .Musk traveled to moscow with jim cantrel (an aerospace supplies fixer),and Adeo Ressi(his
best friend from college),to buy refurbished Dnepr intercontinatal ballistic missiles(ICBMS)that could
send the envisioned payload into space. the group met with companies such as NPO lavochkin and Kosmotor
however according to centrell,Musk was seen as a novice and was conesquantly spat on by one of the russian  
chief designers.{71}the group returned to the united states emppty-handed in ferburay2002 the group
returned to russia to look for there ICBMS bringing along Mike griffin griffin had worked for the CIA's                                                                    
venture capital arm in q-tel as well as NASA's Jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving 
orbital sciences a marker of satellites and spacecraft.the group had another meeting with kosmotors 
and were offered one rocket for US$8 million.Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the 
meeting.On the flight back from Moscow Musk realized that he could start a company that could build 
the affordable rockets he needed.{71}According to early tesla and spacex investor steve jusvetson ,{72}
mussk calculated that he rew materials for buliding a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of
a rocket at the time.it was conculuded that,in theory,by applying vertical integration and the modular 
approach employed in software engineering,SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still 
enjoy a 70-percent grossmargin.{73}ultimately,Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-time goal of 
creating a ture spacefaring civilization.{74}
