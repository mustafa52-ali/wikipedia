<h2><a href="#">EARLY LIFE</a></h2>
<p>
Elon musk was born of june 1971<a href="#"> pretoria</a> ransvaal, South Africa,[24][25].the son of maye musk (ne haldeman)a model and 
dietitan from regina Saskatchewan, Canada,[26][27][28]and errol musk a southafrica<a href="#"> electromahenical engineer</a> pilot 
and sailor {29}.he was a younger brother ,kimbal born(1972).and a younger sister  tosca(born 1974){33}{28]
 His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[34].his patarenal grandmother was
 british andhe also has <a href="#">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> ancestry.[35][36] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly
  with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[35] a choice he made two years after his parents separated but which he
   subsequently regretted.[37] Musk is estranged from His
 father whom he has referred to as "a terrible human being"{37}.he also has a half-sister{38}.and-a half-brother{39}.
</p>
<p>
 During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[40] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing while using 
the <a href="#"> commodore VIC-20.{41}</a> taught himself <a href="#">computer programming</a>   and by the age 10,sold the code of a basic-based
video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximatley $500{42}{43}.his chidhood
reading included <a href="#">isaac Asimov</a>'s <a href="#">Foundation</a> series, from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of 
actions they are likely to prolong civilization minimize the probability of a dark age reduce the lenght of a dark age
if there is one ".{37}
</p>
<p>Musk was severly bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a
 flight of stairs.[37][40][44][45]
Musk attended <a herf="#">waterkloof house preparatory school</a> and <a href="#"">bryanston high school{44}</a>before graduating from <a href="#">pretoria boys
high school</a>.{45}although musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria,Musk became determined to move to the
united states saying"i remember thinking and seeing that america is where great things are possible,more than any other
country in the world ."{46}Musk knew it would be easier to get to the united states from canada and moved there against
his father's wishes in june before his 18th birthday,{47}after obtaining a canadian passport through his canadian-born
mother.{48}{49}
</p>
<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
<p>While awaiting canadian documentation,Musk attented the <a href="#">university of petoria</a> for five months>{51}Once in canada
Musk entered<a href="#"> queen'suniversity</a> in 1989,avoiding mandatory service in the<a href="#"> southafrica military.</a> left in 1992 to
study business and physics at the <a href="#">University of Pennsylvania;</a> he graduated with a bachelor of science degree in
economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[52][53]
</p>
<p>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up
called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, aand at
 the Palo Alto-based start-up rocket science games.{54}His work at rocket science games involved<a href="#"> assembly programming</a>
of <a href="#">device driver</a> Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind apple's quicktime who had  hired Musk, noted: “
He had boundless energy .kids  these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works,
 but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.”[55]
</p>
<p>In 1995,Musk commenced a PhD in <a href="#">energy physics/materials science</a> at <a href="#">stanford university</a> in califorina Eager to pursue
opportunities in the internet boom,he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company,Zip2 corporation
</p>
<h2>CAREER</h2>
<h2>ZIP2</h2>
<p>main article:zip2</p>
<p>In 1995 Musk and his brother ,<a href="#">kimbal</a> ,started zip2 a web software company,with money raised from a small group
of <a href="#"> angel investor</a>.{37}the company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the <a href="#">newspaper</a> publishing industary
with map direction and yellow pages.{57}{58}the vector graphics mapping and direction code was implemented by Musk 
in Java.{59}Musk obtained contracts with <a href="#">the new york times</a> and the<a href="#"> chicago tribune{60}</a> persuaded the board of
directors to abandon plans for a merger with citysearch.{61}Musk,s attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the 
board.{40}COMPAQ acquired zip2 for us$307 million in cash.{40}109 in ferburay 1999.{62}Musk received us$22million
for his 7 percent share from the sale.{60}{40}109
</p>
<h2>X.COM AND PAYPAL</h2>
<p>Main articles: PayPal and X.com
In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million
from the sale of Zip2.[47][57][61] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[60][63] which had a money
-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a <a href="#">viral marketing</a> campaign where new customers were recruited when 
they received money through the service.[64] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO 
(although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move 
PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to<a href="#"> Microsoft Windows.[65]</a> In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for 
US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million.[66] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's 
largest <a href="#">shareholder,</a> owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[67]
In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental
value to him.[68]
</p>
<h2>SPACE X</h2>
<p>Main article:SpaceX
In 2001,Musk concived <a href="#">Mars oasis</a> a project to land a  miniature experimentel green house on mars containing 
food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempet to rewanken public interset in space exploration.
in october 2001 .Musk traveled to moscow with jim cantrel (an aerospace supplies fixer),and Adeo Ressi(his
best friend from college),to buy refurbished Dnepr intercontinatal ballistic missiles(ICBMS)that could
send the envisioned payload into space. the group met with companies such as NPO lavochkin and Kosmotor
however according to centrell,Musk was seen as a novice and was conesquantly spat on by one of the russian  
chief designers.{71}the group returned to the united states emppty-handed in ferburay2002 the group
returned to russia to look for there ICBMS bringing along Mike griffin griffin had worked for the CIA's                                                                    
venture capital arm in q-tel as well as NASA's Jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving 
orbital sciences a marker of satellites and spacecraft.the group had another meeting with kosmotors 
and were offered one rocket for US$8 million.Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the 
meeting.On the flight back from Moscow Musk realized that he could start a company that could build 
the affordable rockets he needed.{71}According to early tesla and spacex investor steve jusvetson ,{72}
mussk calculated that he rew materials for buliding a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of
a rocket at the time.it was conculuded that,in theory,by applying vertical integration and the modular 
approach employed in software engineering,SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still 
enjoy a 70-percent grossmargin.{73}ultimately,Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-time goal of 
creating a ture spacefaring civilization.{74} 
</p>
<p>With us$100million of his early fortune ,{75}Msuk founded space exploration technologies,or spaceX in May 2002.{76}
Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer(CTO)of the HAWTHORNE,califorina-based company.by
2016 Musk private trust held 54% of spaceX stock,equavalient to 78% of voting shares.{77} 
</p>
<p>spaceX develop and manufacture space launch vehicle with a focus  on advancing the state of rocket technology
the company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and falcon 9 rocket (a nod ti star Wars Millennium Falcon) 
and its spacecraft is the dragon ( a nod to puff magic dragon ).{78}spaceX designed the family of falcon launch 
vehicle and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft  over a span of seven years.in september 2008 spaceX's falcon 1 rocket 
became the first privately funded liquid-fueied vehicle to put a satelitle into earth orbit.{40} 
</p>
<p>spaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest
thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the merlin 1D).{79}{80}SpaceX has produced more than 100 operetional 
merlin 1D engines.Each merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars.in combination, 
the 9 merlin engines in the falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8to 6.7 MN (1.3to 1.5 million pounds) 
of thurst,depending on altitude.{81}  
</p>
<p>in 2006,SpaceX was awarded a contact from NASA to continue the  developmentand test of the SpaceX Falcon 
 launch vehicle and dragonspacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international sapce station,{82}}{failed
verification}followed by a us$1.6billion  NASA commerical resupply program contract on december 23,2008,for 12 flights
of its falcon 9 rockets and dragon spacecraft to the space station,replacing the US space shuttle after it retired 
in 2011.{83} 
</p>
<p>ON may 25,2012 the SpaceX dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commerical 
company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station.{84}astronaut transport to the iss is
currently handled solely by the soyuz but SpaceXis one of two companies awareded a contract by NASA as part of the 
commerical crew developmant program,which is currently projected to develop a US astronaut transport capability
by 2020.{85}
</p>
<p>Musk balivied the key to making space travel affordable was to make rockets reusable,though space industry
expert belived reusable rockets were impossible or infeasible.[86] on december 22,2015 ,SpaceX succesfully landed
 the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an 
 orbital rocket — a significant step to rocket reusability and lower cost access to space.{87} the first stage
</p>recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship,
 an ocean-based recovery platform,[88] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first 
 stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017.
  Twenty out of 42 first stage Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.
  [89]
  In 2017 SpaceX launched 18 successful Falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest previous year of 8.[90]
<p></p> February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built 
(after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket inoperation as of 2018.
 The inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.[91]</p>
<p>SpaceX began development of the Starlink consellation of low earth orbit satellities in 2015 to provide 
global internet coverge with an intinal 60 satellities launched on 24 May 2019.
</p>
<p>Musk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series[92] and views space exploration as an important step in 
preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life.[93] Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a
hedge against threats to the survival of the human species.</p>
<p>An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus,
inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could 
spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years, atomic weaponry 
created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue
ball—or go extinct.</p>
<p>Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.[94] In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to 
send humans to Mars' surface within 10–20 years.[95] In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to 
establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.[41] Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks 
oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).
[96] Musk stated in June 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger Interplanetary Spaceship was aimed for 
departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first crewed ITS Mars flight departing in 2024.[97]
In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his architecture to explore and colonize Mars.[98]</p>
<p></p>In late 2017, SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon 
Rocket (BFR), that would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large vehicles:
Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth, and totally
 replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. Starship will have a 9-meter (30 ft) core diameter. 
 Significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in September 2019,[99] while 
 the new rocket engine (Raptor) development began in 2012,[100][101] with a first test flight performed in August 2019.
